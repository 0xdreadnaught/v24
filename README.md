# Voron 2.6873 - Lilith

This repository contains configuration backups and custom scripts for my Voron 2.4, dubbed Lilith. 
Lilith, the evil daughter of Diablo, parallels 3D printing's dark allureâ€”both look cool and may burn your house down in the middle of the night.

These scripts and configs are not intended for public replication but serve as a cautionary showcase of what not to do with your Voron 2.4.
The base printer is a Siboor v2.4r2 Aug(Dec refresh). The only thing remaining from Siboor is the OS on the BTT-pi.


### Fans
- **Stepper Driver Cooling**: Employs a 5010 5V blower to cool the Octopus Pro stepper drivers.
  - [@SimplifiedLife](https://www.printables.com/@SimplifiedLife)'s shroud https://www.printables.com/model/494141-ultra-cool-btt-octopus-stepper-driver-fan-duct
    - I did have to cut off the last driver segment because it was colliding with the fuse. It has no impact on performance.

- **Nevermore V6**: Activated charcoal air purification system (wiring incomplete).
  - [@nevermore3d](https://github.com/nevermore3d)'s infamous filter https://github.com/nevermore3d/Nevermore_Micro/tree/master/V6

- **Chamber Vortex**: An ongoing project to install custom activated charcoal/HEPA filtration.
  - My "design", `stls/vortex_blowers_l_r.stl`, use supports.
    - The mount is a remix of [@Sarge013](https://www.printables.com/@Sarge013)'s poop bucket mount.
    - May need to move it a tad further away, 2mil plate clearance currently. We'll see if it melts during ABS/ASA prints.

### Buckets
- **Poop Bucket**: Catches the purge blobs.
  - From [@Sarge013](https://www.printables.com/@Sarge013)'s imodel https://www.printables.com/model/380486-voron-prime-pellet-bucket
  - Modified with a cable channel and SBC cutout to allow the UFP sensor to run under it. It was that or builr a cable for it.
    - STL not yet added to `stls/`.

- **Dingleberry Bucket**: Catches leaking filament and wipes against a brush.

### Sensors
- **Ultra Fine Partical(UFP) Sensor**: Detect dust and other fine particals in the chamber.
  - AITRIP SDS011.
  - Detection ranges: 0.3-2.5 microns & 2.5-10.0 microns.
  - Polled with `python3 ufp_check.py` for now.

- **Volatile Organic Compound(VOC) Sensor**: Detect VOCs in the chamber.
  - SGP40. Not yet wired up.
 
- **X/Y Endstops**: Sensorless homing just seems silly to me when microswitches are accurate, cheap, small, and easy to setup.
  - The Chaotic Lab CNC kit would crash into itself during homing, mainly the Y axis. To remediate this I just stuck some tabs from a cut up CompTIA Pentest+ card. The red matches well.
    - This also stopped the toolhead from catching on the cable chain, which happened every once in a while.

### Macros
- **Print Start**: Modified better print_start macro.
  - Gets bed/nozzle/chamber temps and max X,Y ranges.
  - Enbles BTT filament sensor's encoder (off on boot with delayed gcode).
  - Enables BTT filament sensor's switch (off on boot with delayed gcode).
  - Full XYZ home.
  - Chamber soak if needed.
  - Quad_Gantry_Level if needed.
  - Stable_Z_Home to ensure z-offset accuracy.
    - Checks z-offset until it stops deviating. This helps ensure the bed has fully expanded from the heat.
    - From [@matthewlloyd](https://github.com/matthewlloyd)'s project: https://github.com/matthewlloyd/Klipper-Stable-Z-Home
  - Adaptive bed mesh.
    - Margin 5 seems to work well. Slicer has range set to build dimensions.
  - Move to corner and heat up nozzle to target temp
  - PRIMING
  - CLEAN
- **PRINT_END**: Standard end macro.
  - Clear the bed mesh just to be sure it can't be loaded by accident on the next print.
  - Disable Filament encoder and switch sensors.
- **PRIMING**: Purge poop.
  - CLEAN.
  - Create poop blob.
  - Wipe nozzle off to the right.
  - Kick poop off to the left into the bucket.
  - CLEAN.

https://github.com/0xdreadnaught/v24/assets/983663/5e7ff68e-c6dc-4241-8806-f2f68643afed

    
- **CLEAN**: Poop wipe.
  - Wipe nozzle a little.
- **PAUSE**: Modified Ellis' PAUSE macro.
  - Save off X,Y,Z to file to bypass lack of custom variable support.
- **RESUME**: Modified Ellis' RESUME macro.
  - Load X,Y,Z from file and move Z last to mitigate nozzle collisions as much as possible.
- **M486**: Cancel Object command for Exclude Object support.
- **Calibrate_Estep**: Aid for calibration e-step/rotation_distance.
  - Home Z.
  - Move to 50mm off build plate.
  - Move to front center.
  - Set nozzle to specified temp, 150 if not specified.
    
### Scripts
- **save_toolhead_pos.sh**(Deprecated): Save the current XYZ location for the PAUSE macro.
  - Ensure `/tmp/toolhead_position.txt` exists.
  - echo args $1-$3, X,Y,Z to `toolhead_position.txt`.
    - The need for this arose from Klipper not wanting to pass custom variables between macros and I wanted a safer RESUME path.
- **restore_toolhead_pos.sh**(Deprecated): Move the toolhead back to the original position.
  - Gets the X,Y,Z from `toolhead_position.txt`.
  - Sends `G90` to the printer's MCU socket file, `/tmp/printer/mcu_socket` for me, somtimes it's `/tmp/printer`.
  - Sends the X, then Y moves.
    - Handling Z this way caused random problems so I have that handled in the macro when it turns the nozzle back on.
- **wipe_toolhead_pos.sh**(Deprecated): Purge `toolhead_position.txt` contents.
  - Just minor security considering shell command access is risky.
- **ufp_check.py**: Get the UFP sensor data.
  - Still WIP since there's no native way to add this data into mainsail. Will likely build a Klipper-Screen replacement.

### Quirks
- **No Back Panel**: The back panel is currently removed to facilitate PLA printing. Other panels let in too much dog hair(yay husky and 2x labs lol).
  - Using a custom mount for the filament couplers for now.

## Warning
Proceed with caution: Implementing configurations or scripts from this repository should be done at your own risk, with a fire extinguisher readily available.


# To-Do

## Firmware and Software Enhancements
- [x] Refactor pause/resume macros to use Klipper's internal variable system instead of shell commands.

## Sensor Integration and Data Aggregation
- [ ] Wire up the VOC sensor to the printer.
- [ ] Develop a script for aggregating VOC sensor data, drawing inspiration from `ufp_check.py`.

## Interface Development
- [ ] Design and implement a new LCD interface to display UFP/VOC sensor data and provide quick-access printer commands (pause/resume/cancel).
- [ ] Incorporate a physical switch to toggle between klipper-screen and the new interface.

## Hardware Installation
- [ ] Pin and connect the Nevermore V6 carbon filter.
- [ ] Install and wire the vortex blowers, using wago clips to connect to the Octopus board.

## Structural Build-out
- [ ] Construct and mount the back panel and exhaust system, including the filter pod (can be initially empty).
- [ ] Design and fabricate an external air filtration pod using 20x20 aluminum extrusions and PC paneling to match the main chassis.
  - [ ] Ensure the pod includes activated charcoal and HEPA filters, alongside fans for proper airflow.
